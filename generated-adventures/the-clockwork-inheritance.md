# The Clockwork Inheritance
**A gnome inventor's death triggers his mechanical guardians' rampage** | Level 4

## Hook
Imagineer Colmarr Rivenstone of Gond's faith died peacefully in his Waterdeep workshop three days ago. Now his mechanical creations have barricaded the building, attacking anyone who approaches. His niece Jaree Rivenstone, a fellow gnome, hires the party to retrieve his will before the City Watch burns the place down.

## Encounters
- **Workshop Perimeter**: Two **Flying Swords** (CR 1/4, 50 XP each) patrol the windows, attacking anyone who peers inside; DC 14 (Medium) Dexterity (Stealth) to approach undetected
- **The Clockwork Guardian**: A **Helmed Horror** (CR 4, 1,100 XP) guards the main door, following Colmarr's final command: "Let no one disturb my work"
- **Trap Gallery**: Colmarr's paranoid security system—pressure plates trigger **Animated Armor** (CR 1, 200 XP) from alcoves; DC 15 (Medium) Intelligence (Investigation) spots the triggers
- **The Will Puzzle**: Colmarr's safe requires solving a gear-based puzzle (DC 16 Medium Intelligence check) or picking the lock (DC 18 Hard Dexterity with thieves' tools)

## Rivenstone Workshop
A three-story townhouse converted into a tinker's paradise. Every surface holds half-finished inventions, and the smell of oil permeates everything.

### Ground Floor - Showroom
Display cases of mechanical curiosities line the walls. Two **Flying Swords** hover near the windows. The main door is reinforced (AC 19, 27 HP) and guarded by a **Helmed Horror** that attacks anyone attempting to enter by force. The horror can be bypassed with a DC 18 (Hard) Charisma (Persuasion) check if the party claims to be "continuing Colmarr's work."

### Second Floor - Workshop
Workbenches covered in gears, springs, and arcane components. Three pressure plates (DC 15 Medium Investigation to spot) trigger **Animated Armor** from wall alcoves. A fourth suit stands dormant—Colmarr's unfinished masterpiece, which Jaree may want retrieved.

### Third Floor - Study
Colmarr's personal quarters. His body has been preserved by a *gentle repose* spell cast by the local Gond temple. The iron safe (DC 18 Hard thieves' tools, or DC 16 Medium Intelligence puzzle) contains his will, leaving everything to Jaree—including the command phrases to deactivate all guardians.

**Villain Motivation**: The Helmed Horror wants to protect Colmarr's legacy because its final orders were to guard his work, and it lacks the sapience to understand Colmarr's death changes everything. It is not evil—merely following programming.

**Resolution**: Retrieving the will and reading the command phrases ("The Wonderbringer's work is done") deactivates all constructs. Destroying the Helmed Horror triggers the remaining constructs to fight to the death. Jaree pays 300 gp and offers the unfinished armor suit as a bonus if the party retrieves it intact.

*XP Budget: 1,500 (Moderate for Level 4). Full combat: Helmed Horror (1,100) + Animated Armor (200) + Flying Swords (100) = 1,400 XP.*
