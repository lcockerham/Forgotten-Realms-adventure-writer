# The Moonbridge Betrayal
**A Selûnite temple hides a Sharran assassin preparing to strike during the lunar eclipse** | Level 7

## Hook
Silverstar Lynneth Dulsaer of Selûne's House of the Moon in Waterdeep has received a prophetic dream: during tomorrow's lunar eclipse, a "shadow wearing silver" will murder the High Moonmistress. She secretly contacts the party rather than temple guards—she fears the assassin is someone she trusts.

## Encounters
- **Temple Investigation**: DC 17 (Medium) Wisdom (Insight) during interviews reveals Acolyte Courynna Aengrilor has been "visiting family" frequently; DC 19 (Hard) Intelligence (Investigation) in her quarters finds a hidden Sharran holy symbol
- **The False Ally**: Courynna attempts to mislead the investigation, pointing suspicion at the temple's dwarf groundskeeper Belmara Crownshield
- **Catacombs Ambush**: Two **Shadows** (CR 1/2, 100 XP each) and a **Shadow Demon** (CR 4, 1,100 XP) attack if the party investigates the crypts beneath the temple
- **Eclipse Confrontation**: At moonrise, Courynna reveals herself as a **Spy** with the abilities of a **Shadow Sorcerer** (use Mage stats, CR 6, 2,300 XP) and attempts to assassinate the High Moonmistress

## House of the Moon
An elegant temple in Waterdeep's Sea Ward, with silver-inlaid domes and moonstone windows. The crypts below hold generations of faithful Selûnites.

### Sanctuary
A circular chamber beneath a domed ceiling painted with the phases of the moon. During the eclipse, the High Moonmistress will lead prayers here—the most vulnerable moment.

### Acolyte Quarters
Courynna's room appears normal. DC 19 (Hard) Investigation finds a loose floorboard containing a Sharran holy symbol, a vial of poison (injury, DC 15 Constitution save or 4d6 poison damage), and coded messages referencing "the shadow's gift."

### Crypts
Ancient burial chambers. Courynna has summoned a **Shadow Demon** and two **Shadows** to guard her escape route—a secret tunnel to the sewers. DC 16 (Medium) Perception notices fresh scratches on a sarcophagus concealing the tunnel entrance.

### Bell Tower
Courynna's planned assassination point—she can see the sanctuary clearly through a moonstone window. If cornered here, she fights to the death rather than face Sharran punishment for failure.

**Villain Motivation**: Courynna wants to kill the High Moonmistress because Shar promised to reunite her with her twin sister (a Selûnite who died in a previous Shar-Selûne conflict)—a lie, but Courynna's grief makes her believe.

**Resolution**: Exposing Courynna before the eclipse prevents the assassination. If combat occurs during the eclipse, the High Moonmistress aids the party with *moonbeam* spells. Courynna carries evidence linking her handler to a Sharran cell in Waterdeep's Dock Ward, leading to future adventures. Silverstar Lynneth rewards the party with a *moonblade dagger* (+1 dagger that sheds moonlight on command).

---
*XP Budget: 5,200 (Moderate for Level 7). Main encounter: Shadow Sorcerer (2,300) solo or with Shadows if party attacked early. Full dungeon: Shadow Demon (1,100) + Shadows (200) + Shadow Sorcerer (2,300) = 3,600 XP combat.*
