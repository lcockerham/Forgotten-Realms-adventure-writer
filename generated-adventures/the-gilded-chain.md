# The Gilded Chain
**Zhentarim slavers use a legitimate merchant house as cover for soul trafficking** | Level 6

## Hook
Harper agent Stedd Evenwood approaches the party in a Baldur's Gate tavern. A Zhentarim operation is selling souls—not slaves, actual souls—to devils through the respected Calabra Trading Company. He needs proof before the Harpers can act, and the next "auction" is in two days.

## Encounters
- **Infiltrating the Auction**: DC 16 (Medium) Charisma (Deception) to pose as buyers; DC 18 (Hard) Dexterity (Stealth) to sneak in through the warehouse skylight
- **The Soul Jars**: Six *soul coins* containing trapped souls are displayed; DC 15 (Medium) Intelligence (Arcana) reveals they can only be freed by destroying the coins or fulfilling infernal contracts
- **The Devil's Advocate**: A **Cambion** named Verathrax (CR 5, 1,800 XP) oversees the transaction, flanked by two **Spined Devils** (CR 2, 450 XP each)
- **Warehouse Battle**: If cover is blown, Zhentarim **Thugs** (CR 1/2, 100 XP each) and a **Bandit Captain** (CR 2, 450 XP) join the fight

## Calabra Warehouse
A legitimate-looking warehouse near Baldur's Gate's harbor. The basement has been converted into a hellish auction house with red drapes, iron braziers, and a stage displaying the soul coins.

### Loading Dock
Crates of mundane goods provide cover. Two **Thugs** guard the main entrance. A locked side door (DC 15 Medium thieves' tools) leads to the office.

### Office
Merchant records that appear legitimate. DC 17 (Hard) Investigation finds a hidden ledger documenting "special merchandise" with buyer names—including three Baldur's Gate nobles. This evidence is worth 500 gp to the Harpers.

### Auction Floor (Basement)
Red silk drapes hide stone walls carved with infernal script. The **Cambion** Verathrax stands on a raised platform, soul coins displayed in a glass case behind him. Two **Spined Devils** perch on iron chandeliers. Four wealthy buyers (use **Noble** stats but non-combatants) sit in velvet chairs.

If combat begins, the buyers flee. Verathrax fights for 3 rounds before attempting to plane shift with as many soul coins as he can grab. The **Bandit Captain** Marcon Calabra and four **Thugs** arrive from upstairs on round 2.

**Villain Motivation**: Verathrax wants mortal souls because each soul delivered to Avernus advances his standing with Zariel—he seeks promotion from cambion to full devil through a quota of corrupted souls.

**Resolution**: Killing or driving off Verathrax and seizing the soul coins provides evidence for the Harpers. The coins can be destroyed (freeing the souls to Kelemvor's judgment) or kept (each functions as a *soul coin* per Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus). Stedd Evenwood pays 600 gp and offers Harper membership to interested party members.

*XP Budget: 4,000 (Moderate for Level 6). Main encounter: Cambion (1,800) + Spined Devils (900) = 2,700 XP. Full combat adds Bandit Captain (450) + Thugs (400) = 3,550 XP total.*
