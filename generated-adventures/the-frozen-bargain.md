# The Frozen Bargain
**A desperate village traded their children's futures to a hag for survival—now she's collecting** | Level 9

## Hook
Twenty years ago, the Icewind Dale village of Bremen faced extinction in a terrible blizzard. Elder Betha Stormwind admits the elders made a pact with a creature of the ice—and now that creature has returned. Three young adults have vanished, and the hag demands the rest "or the cold takes everyone."

## Encounters
- **Village Secrets**: DC 18 (Medium) Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) gets the elders to reveal the full pact—they promised "the fruits of their labor" without understanding it meant their children; DC 20 (Hard) Intelligence (Arcana) identifies the creature as a bheur hag
- **Tracking the Taken**: DC 17 (Medium) Wisdom (Survival) follows the hag's trail across the tundra; a **Winter Wolf** (CR 3, 700 XP) pack (3 wolves) harasses the party
- **The Ice Grotto**: A frozen cave where the hag keeps her "collection"—the missing young adults frozen in magical ice
- **Confronting Aurilax**: The **Bheur Hag** (use Night Hag stats with cold-themed abilities, CR 5, 1,800 XP) offers to release the captives if the party brings her "a heart that truly loves Bremen"

## The Frozen Hollow
A natural ice cave transformed by hag magic into a crystalline prison. Temperatures are supernaturally cold—unprotected creatures take 2d10 cold damage per 10 minutes.

### Tundra Approach
Three **Winter Wolves** patrol the glacial approach, attacking any who approach the cave. They flee if two are killed.

### Entry Chamber
Icicles hang like bars across the entrance. DC 16 (Medium) Strength check to break through, or DC 18 (Hard) Dexterity (thieves' tools) to pick the ice-lock without triggering an alarm.

### The Collection
Six crystalline pillars contain frozen figures—three are the missing villagers (Stor, Kethra, and Lander), three are older victims from other villages. A **Yeti** (CR 3, 700 XP) guards this chamber, bound to the hag's service.

### The Hag's Sanctum
Aurilax (**Night Hag** reskinned as bheur hag, CR 5, 1,800 XP) lounges on a throne of bones, attended by two **Ice Mephits** (CR 1/2, 100 XP each). She wears Elder Betha's wedding ring—taken as collateral twenty years ago.

Aurilax proposes a bargain: bring her someone who "truly loves Bremen" (meaning Elder Betha herself), and she'll release the captives. If the party attacks, she uses *Etherealness* to flee, cursing Bremen with eternal winter unless they accept her terms.

**Villain Motivation**: Aurilax wants Bremen's youth because she feeds on crushed hope and broken futures—watching parents sacrifice their children sustains her more than any physical meal.

**Resolution**: Combat can kill Aurilax, but she'll attempt to flee to the Ethereal Plane if reduced below 20 HP. Melting the ice pillars (fire damage or *remove curse*) frees the captives. A DC 20 (Hard) Charisma (Persuasion) check can convince Aurilax to accept a different bargain—the party's service for one task (a future adventure hook). Elder Betha offers herself willingly if the party returns empty-handed, ending the curse but damning her soul.

*XP Budget: 8,000 (Moderate for Level 9). Full encounter: Night Hag (1,800) + Yeti (700) + Ice Mephits (200) + Winter Wolves (2,100) = 4,800 XP. Encounter is under budget but hag's Etherealness makes it challenging.*
