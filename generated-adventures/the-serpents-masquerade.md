# The Serpent's Masquerade
**Yuan-ti infiltrators plan to poison Waterdeep's nobility at the Midsummer Ball** | Level 10

## Hook
A dying **yuan-ti pureblood** stumbles into the Yawning Portal, a crossbow bolt in her back. With her last breath, she gasps: "Midsummer... the wine... House Gralhund... they'll kill them all." She was a defector trying to warn the city. The Midsummer Ball is tomorrow night.

## Encounters
- **Investigating the Defector**: DC 20 (Medium) Intelligence (Investigation) of her belongings finds a signet ring from House Gralhund and a vial of colorless poison (yuan-ti deathsleep venom); DC 18 (Medium) Wisdom (Medicine) on her body reveals scale patterns hidden beneath her skin
- **House Gralhund**: The noble family has been replaced by yuan-ti infiltrators. DC 22 (Hard) Wisdom (Insight) during social interaction notices Lady "Gralhund" never blinks
- **The Wine Cellar**: The poison is hidden in wine casks destined for the ball. Two **Yuan-ti Malisons** (CR 3, 700 XP each) and four **Yuan-ti Purebloods** (CR 1, 200 XP each) guard the operation
- **The Abomination's Gambit**: High Serpent Sithess (**Yuan-ti Abomination**, CR 7, 2,900 XP) wears Lady Gralhund's face and attends the ball personally

## House Gralhund
A wealthy noble villa in Waterdeep's North Ward. The real Gralhunds are kept alive in the basement—valuable hostages and sources of information.

### Main Hall
Servants (four **Yuan-ti Purebloods** in disguise) prepare for a pre-ball gathering. They maintain cover unless directly threatened. DC 20 (Medium) Perception notices their movements are unnaturally synchronized.

### Wine Cellar
Fifty casks of wine, twelve poisoned. DC 18 (Medium) Intelligence (Investigation) identifies the poisoned casks by subtle scale-pattern markings. Two **Yuan-ti Malisons** attack anyone who threatens the wine.

### Hidden Basement
The real Lord and Lady Gralhund, plus their two children, are imprisoned here. A **Yuan-ti Broodguard** (CR 2, 450 XP) stands watch. Freeing them provides witnesses—and grateful noble allies.

### Lady's Chambers
High Serpent Sithess (**Yuan-ti Abomination**) prepares to attend the ball. If confronted before the ball, she attempts to negotiate: "The humans breed like vermin. We cull them for the good of all. Stand aside, and Dendar will spare you when she wakes." If combat occurs, she summons two **Swarms of Poisonous Snakes** (CR 2, 450 XP each) from her chambers.

**Villain Motivation**: Sithess wants to assassinate Waterdeep's nobility because the Serpent Hills yuan-ti believe destabilizing surface cities hastens Dendar the Night Serpent's awakening—the poisoning is a religious act, not political.

**Resolution**: Stopping the poisoning saves hundreds of lives and earns the Open Lord's gratitude—1,000 gp reward and a favor from Laeral Silverhand. Killing Sithess ends the immediate threat but yuan-ti retaliation becomes a future concern. The real Gralhunds reward rescuers with a 500 gp gemstone and lifetime invitations to noble functions.
