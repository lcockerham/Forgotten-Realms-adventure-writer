# The Last Crusade
**A fallen paladin seeks redemption by destroying the death knight who corrupted him** | Level 12

## Hook
Sir Orel Marsk, once a Champion of Torm, approaches the party in Suzail. He wears no holy symbol—his god has forsaken him. Twenty years ago, Death Knight Varagoth Nemetsk corrupted Orel into breaking his oaths. Now Orel has learned Varagoth's phylactery location and seeks allies for a final assault. "I cannot destroy him alone, and I will not die unredeemed."

## Encounters
- **Planning the Assault**: Orel shares intelligence on Varagoth's fortress in the Thunder Peaks. DC 20 (Medium) Intelligence (History) recalls Varagoth was a Damaran knight who served Zhengyi the Witch-King before his transformation
- **Mountain Approach**: **Wyverns** (CR 6, 2,300 XP each)—a mated pair—nest near the fortress entrance, attacking anyone who approaches
- **The Fallen Host**: Varagoth commands undead soldiers. Four **Wights** (CR 3, 700 XP each) and eight **Skeletons** (CR 1/4, 50 XP each) patrol the outer fortress
- **Death Knight's Challenge**: Varagoth offers Orel a chance to "complete his fall" by killing an innocent hostage—a Tormite acolyte named Pavel Chernin

## Fortress Nemetsk
A ruined Damaran watchtower on a Thunder Peaks cliff, expanded by dark magic into a monument to Varagoth's hatred.

### Cliffside Approach
Two **Wyverns** (CR 6, 2,300 XP each) attack intruders. The cliff requires DC 15 (Easy for Level 12) Strength (Athletics) to climb; failure means 6d10 falling damage.

### Outer Bailey
Crumbling walls patrolled by **Wights** and **Skeletons**. A DC 18 (Medium) Dexterity (Stealth) check allows the party to reach the keep undetected.

### Great Hall
Varagoth's throne room. Banners of Zhengyi the Witch-King hang from the walls. The acolyte Pavel is chained to a pillar. **Death Knight Varagoth Nemetsk** (CR 17, 18,000 XP) sits on a throne of bones, flanked by two **Flameskull** advisors (CR 4, 1,100 XP each).

Varagoth recognizes Orel immediately: "You came to finish what we started, little brother? Torm still won't take you back. Kill the boy and embrace what you truly are."

### Phylactery Vault
Behind the throne, a locked iron door (DC 20 Hard thieves' tools) leads to Varagoth's phylactery—his original holy symbol of Torm, corrupted with Zhengyi's blood magic. Destroying it (AC 18, 50 HP, immune to non-magical damage) allows Varagoth to be permanently slain.

**Villain Motivation**: Varagoth wants to corrupt Orel completely because Orel's continued struggle for redemption proves Varagoth's own fall wasn't inevitable—destroying Orel's hope validates Varagoth's choice to embrace darkness.

**Resolution**: Destroying the phylactery and defeating Varagoth permanently ends his threat. Orel fights alongside the party but focuses on reaching the phylactery. If the party saves Pavel and destroys Varagoth, a vision of Torm appears to Orel, offering one final chance at redemption—a pilgrimage to the Monastery of the Yellow Rose. Torm's blessing grants each party member a *charm of heroism* (3 uses of *heroism* spell).

*XP Budget: 14,800 (Moderate for Level 12). Death Knight (18,000) exceeds budget but Orel fights alongside party (treat as allied CR 9 Champion). Realistic encounter: Death Knight + Flameskulls (20,200) vs party + Orel (effective +5,000 XP budget) = challenging but appropriate.*
