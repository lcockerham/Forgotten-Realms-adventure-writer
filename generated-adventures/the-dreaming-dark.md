# The Dreaming Dark
**An illithid elder brain's psychic echo traps a village in an endless nightmare** | Level 14

## Hook
The village of Shadowdale has not woken in three days. Elminster himself is trapped in the shared dream, his mental defenses the only thing keeping the sleepers alive. His apprentice, the wizard Jastra Moondown, begs the party to enter the dream and destroy whatever holds them—before the sleepers' bodies fail.

## Encounters
- **Entering the Dream**: Jastra casts *dream* enhanced by Elminster's contingency. DC 22 (Medium) Wisdom saving throw to maintain identity upon entry; failure means starting with 2 levels of exhaustion
- **The Dreaming Village**: Shadowdale exists in the dream, but wrong—buildings shift, faces blur, and shadows have too many limbs. DC 20 (Medium) Intelligence (Investigation) reveals the source: a pulsing tower where the Old Skull Inn should be
- **Nightmare Guardians**: The elder brain's psychic defenses manifest as **Mind Flayers** (CR 7, 2,900 XP each)—three guard the dream-tower
- **The Echo's Core**: The dying psychic imprint of Elder Brain Qualith, destroyed by Elminster decades ago, has reformed in the collective unconscious of Shadowdale's inhabitants

## The Dream of Shadowdale
A twisted reflection of the real village, filtered through alien perception. Colors are wrong, gravity shifts unexpectedly, and every sleeper's fears manifest as environmental hazards.

### Dream Streets
Buildings rearrange themselves. DC 18 (Medium) Wisdom (Perception) to navigate without becoming lost. Lost characters encounter their personal nightmares (DM's discretion—thematically appropriate CR 5-8 creatures).

### The Mind Tower
A pillar of pulsing purple flesh where the Old Skull Inn should stand. Three **Mind Flayers** guard the entrance, attacking intruders but unable to leave the tower's vicinity.

### Elminster's Prison
Halfway up the tower, Elminster Aumar fights an endless battle against nightmare constructs. Freeing him (destroying the constructs—treat as two **Intellect Devourers**, CR 2, 450 XP each, with 50 HP each) grants the party a powerful ally for the final confrontation.

### The Echo Chamber
At the tower's peak, the psychic remnant of **Elder Brain Qualith** (use Elder Brain stats, CR 14, 11,500 XP) floats in a pool of dream-substance. It cannot fully manifest physically but commands formidable psychic power. Two **Intellect Devourers** (CR 2, 450 XP each) serve as its eyes.

Qualith speaks through stolen voices: "The sage destroyed my body. But thought cannot be killed. Every dreaming mind in this village feeds my return. Soon I will wake in flesh again."

**Villain Motivation**: Qualith wants to reconstitute itself because an elder brain's consciousness cannot accept nonexistence—it has spent decades gathering psychic fragments and finally found enough sleeping minds to attempt resurrection.

**Resolution**: Destroying the Echo ends the nightmare and wakes the village. Qualith cannot be reasoned with—it is not truly sapient anymore, merely a psychic hunger wearing an elder brain's memories. Elminster aids the final battle if freed, contributing legendary actions (3/round: cast *counterspell*, deal 4d10 psychic damage to one creature, or grant one ally advantage on their next saving throw). Victory earns Elminster's gratitude—he offers to cast one spell of 8th level or lower for each party member, no questions asked.

---
*XP Budget: 24,000 (Moderate for Level 14). Elder Brain (11,500) + Mind Flayers (8,700) + Intellect Devourers (1,800) = 22,000 XP. Elminster's aid balances the difficulty.*
