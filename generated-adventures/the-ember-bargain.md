# The Ember Bargain
**A fire cult's desperate pact threatens to consume a mountain village** | Level 5

## Hook
The village of Secomber has not seen rain in three months. Crops wither, wells run dry, and strange lights flicker on Mount Sulaer each night. Elder Miri Tallstag begs passing adventurers to investigate—she fears her nephew Randal joined a dangerous cult after his wife died in childbirth.

## Encounters
- **Village Investigation**: DC 15 (Medium) Charisma (Persuasion) convinces nervous villagers to share rumors of "fire blessings"; DC 17 (Hard) Intelligence (Religion) identifies symbols scratched on Randal's abandoned home as Kossuth worship mixed with something darker
- **Mountain Ascent**: A **Fire Snake** (CR 1, 200 XP) and two **Magma Mephits** (CR 1/2, 100 XP each) guard the trail, testing the "worthy"
- **The Bargaining Chamber**: Cult Fanatic Randal Tallstag offers the party a deal—help complete the ritual to summon an **Efreeti**, and share in the wishes it grants
- **The Binding Circle**: A trap requiring DC 16 (Medium) Intelligence (Arcana) to disrupt; failure releases a **Fire Elemental** (CR 5, 1,800 XP) prematurely

## The Ember Shrine
A natural cave system converted into a shrine, with magma channels carved into the floor forming a summoning circle. The heat is oppressive; unprotected creatures take 1d10 fire damage per hour.

### Cave Mouth
Obsidian shards crunch underfoot. A **Fire Snake** coils near a brazier of everburning coals, attacking non-cultists on sight.

### The Supplicant's Path
A narrow passage lined with offerings—burnt crops, charred animal bones, a child's toy reduced to ash. Two **Magma Mephits** lurk in wall niches, ambushing intruders.

### Chamber of the Pact
Randal Tallstag (**Cult Fanatic**, CR 2, 450 XP) leads four **Cultists** (CR 1/8, 25 XP each) in maintaining the summoning circle. He is not evil—merely desperate, believing the efreeti will restore the rains if given a proper sacrifice. Two **Acolytes** (CR 1/4, 50 XP each) assist with the ritual.

The incomplete summoning circle can be disrupted (DC 16 Medium Arcana check) or completed. Disruption releases an enraged **Fire Elemental**. Completion summons an **Efreeti** who demands the village as payment—Randal did not read the fine print.

**Villain Motivation**: Randal wants to end the drought because he blames himself for his wife's death and believes saving the village will redeem him—he doesn't realize the efreeti's "bargain" will destroy everything he loves.

**Resolution**: Disrupting the ritual and defeating the elemental breaks the drought (caused by the ritual drawing moisture from the land). Convincing Randal to abandon the pact requires DC 17 (Hard) Charisma (Persuasion) and proof the efreeti will betray him. Either path ends the drought and saves Secomber.

*XP Budget: 3,000 (Moderate for Level 5). Combat path: Fire Elemental (1,800) + Fire Snake (200) + Magma Mephits (200) = 2,200 XP. Social path: Cult Fanatic (450) + Cultists (100) + Acolytes (100) = 650 XP if negotiations fail.*
