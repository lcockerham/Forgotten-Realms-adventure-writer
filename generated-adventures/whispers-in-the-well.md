# Whispers in the Well
**An aboleth's dream seeps into a frontier town's water supply** | Level 8

## Hook
Citizens of Triboar have begun sleepwalking to the town well at midnight, whispering in a language none of them know. Three have drowned themselves. Loremaster Dorn Amblecrown recognizes the words as Deep Speech and fears something ancient has awakened in the aquifer below.

## Encounters
- **Interviewing the Afflicted**: DC 18 (Medium) Wisdom (Insight) reveals the sleepwalkers share fragmented visions of a vast underwater eye; DC 20 (Hard) Intelligence (Arcana) identifies aboleth dream-projection
- **Descending the Well**: A 200-foot descent into an underground lake. DC 16 (Medium) Strength (Athletics) to climb safely; two **Chuuls** (CR 4, 1,100 XP each) lurk 50 feet down, grappling climbers
- **The Drowned Temple**: An aboleth-carved shrine to a forgotten god predating Netheril, now flooded and home to the creature
- **Confronting Xuluthek**: The **Aboleth** offers forbidden knowledge in exchange for surface servants—or fights if refused

## The Sunken Shrine
A pre-Netherese temple carved from living rock, now flooded with dark water. Bioluminescent algae provides dim light. The water is 10 feet deep throughout.

### The Well Shaft
A worked stone shaft descending into darkness. Two **Chuuls** cling to the walls at the 150-foot mark, attacking anyone who descends.

### Drowned Antechamber
Broken pillars rise from the water. Four **Kuo-toa** (CR 1/4, 50 XP each) worship here, enslaved to Xuluthek's will. They attack intruders but flee if two fall.

### The Dreaming Pool
The aboleth **Xuluthek** (CR 10, 5,900 XP) floats in a 60-foot-diameter pool. Three **Kuo-toa Whips** (CR 1, 200 XP each) attend it. Xuluthek projects telepathic visions of Triboar burning, offering to spare the town if the party brings it "three dreamers willing to serve forever."

The water here is Xuluthek's mucus cloud—creatures entering must succeed on a DC 14 (Medium) Constitution saving throw or be unable to breathe air for 1d4 hours.

**Villain Motivation**: Xuluthek wants surface thralls because its previous servants died in a cave-in centuries ago, and it craves the sensations of the surface world it can only experience through enslaved minds.

**Resolution**: Killing Xuluthek ends the dreams immediately—the townspeople recover within a tenday. Accepting Xuluthek's bargain damns three volunteers but saves the town (evil ending). A DC 20 (Hard) Charisma (Deception) check can trick the aboleth into accepting illusory "servants" created by magic, buying time to escape and collapse the tunnel.

*XP Budget: 6,800 (Moderate for Level 8). Main encounter: Aboleth (5,900) + Kuo-toa Whips (600) = 6,500 XP. Full dungeon: add Chuuls (2,200) + Kuo-toa (200) = 8,900 XP (High difficulty).*
