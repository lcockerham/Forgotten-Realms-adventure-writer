# The Salted Tomb
**A dead merchant's vengeful spirit guards a forgotten hoard beneath the docks** | Level 3

## Hook
Dock workers in Baldur's Gate refuse to unload cargo near Warehouse Seven after two stevedores were found dead, their lungs filled with seawater despite dying on dry land. Harbor Master Evendur Buckman offers 200 gp to investigate before the Merchant's League shuts down his operation entirely.

## Encounters
- **Investigating the Warehouse**: DC 13 (Easy) Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals a hidden trapdoor beneath salt-crusted barrels; DC 15 (Medium) Wisdom (Perception) notices spectral dampness on the walls at night
- **The Drowned Guardians**: Two **Specters** of drowned sailors patrol the flooded basement, attacking anyone who touches the cargo
- **The Salt Circle**: A puzzle requiring players to trace Umberlee's symbol in salt to open the inner vault—DC 14 (Medium) Intelligence (Religion) to recall the correct pattern
- **Confronting Gorstag**: The **Ghost** of merchant Gorstag Dundragon demands the party swear to deliver his final shipment to his estranged daughter in Waterdeep, or face his wrath

## The Flooded Vault
A basement excavated into the harbor bedrock, now partially flooded with brackish water. The walls weep moisture and the smell of brine permeates everything.

### Warehouse Floor (Entry)
Salt barrels and rotting crates crowd the space. A DC 13 (Easy) Wisdom (Perception) check spots the trapdoor. Two **Giant Crabs** (CR 1/8, 25 XP each) lurk in a broken crate, attacking if disturbed.

### Flooded Stairs
Slippery stone steps descend into knee-deep seawater. DC 12 (Easy) Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to descend quietly; failure alerts the specters below.

### The Drowning Hall
Waist-deep water fills this chamber. Two **Specters** (CR 1, 200 XP each) rise from the water when intruders enter. The specters cannot pursue beyond this room—bound here by Gorstag's will.

### Inner Vault
Behind a salt-encrusted iron door lies Gorstag's hoard: 450 gp in trade bars, a *potion of water breathing*, and shipping manifests proving his daughter Tessele is his sole heir. **Gorstag Dundragon** (Ghost, CR 4, 1,100 XP) manifests here if the specters are destroyed without completing his task.

**Villain Motivation**: Gorstag wants his estranged daughter Tessele to inherit his wealth because he died before reconciling with her, and his spirit cannot rest until his final wish is fulfilled.

**Resolution**: The party can fight Gorstag (difficult for level 3) or swear to deliver his legacy to Tessele Dundragon in Waterdeep. Completing the oath lays all spirits to rest and earns the party Gorstag's gratitude—and the Harbor Master's gold.

---
*XP Budget: 900 (Moderate for Level 3). Main encounter: Ghost (1,100) is over budget but can be avoided through roleplay; Specters (400 total) + Giant Crabs (50 total) = 450 XP for combat path.*
