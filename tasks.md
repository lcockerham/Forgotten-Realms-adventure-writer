# Adventure Writer Improvement Tasks

Based on evaluation feedback (avg rating: 2.6/5, pass rate: 10%), these are the improvements needed.

## High Priority

- [ ] **Fix DC calculation guidance** - DCs are inconsistent. There is guidance for the DC. Maybe add parenthentical to indicate easy/medium/hard? Is there a way we could test for this as adventures are generated?

- [ ] **Add villain motivation requirement** - Adventures lack clear "why". Add a required field for villain goal/motivation in the adventure template.

- [ ] **Complete story arcs** - Adventures shouldn't end on cliffhangers or leave major plot threads dangling (e.g., the golden rat that does nothing). Each adventure needs a satisfying conclusion.

- [ ] **Monster.md** - Create a monster.md that lists all monsters, areas where they commonly appear, sourcebook, and XP value. Only choose monsters from the list.

- [ ] **Encounter Building rules** - Add rules for encounter building to the skill. Should use the monsters.md. Assumes a party of 4 PCs. Rules for encounter difficulty are in the "encounter difficulty" text file. 

## Medium Priority

- [ ] **Avoid cliche names** - "Pip the halfling" is lazy. Make a names.md to pull from. 

- [ ] **Avoid duplicating published adventures** - Xanathar heist feels like Dragon Heist. Add note to check for overlap with major published modules.

- [ ] **Add NPC detail requirements** - "Three sons" mentioned but never described. Key NPCs need at least one distinguishing detail.

## Low Priority

- [ ] **Monster reskinning guidance** - Add guidance on how to flavor generic monsters for the specific adventure theme.

- [ ] **PC integration hooks** - Consider ways to tie adventures to PC backstories (e.g., "portraits include one of a PC's loved ones").

- [ ] **Logical consistency checklist** - Add a self-check: "If the PCs have X, why would villain offer Y?"
