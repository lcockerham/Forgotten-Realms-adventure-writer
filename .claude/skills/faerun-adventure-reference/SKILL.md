# Faerun Adventure Reference

This skill helps generate high-quality one-page D&D adventures set in the Forgotten Realms (Faerun). Use this when creating adventures similar to those in "Adventures in Faerun."

## Adventure Structure Template

Every one-page adventure follows this structure:

### 1. Header
- **Title**: Evocative, mysterious title (e.g., "The Curse on Humble Hill")
- **Tagline**: Short question or hook (e.g., "Explore an Adventure? (6)")
- **Level**: Target character level clearly stated

### 2. Hook (2-3 sentences)
- Establish the immediate problem or mystery
- Connect to Faerun lore (faction, deity, location, or NPC)
- Create urgency or compelling reason to act
- Example: "The Gaunt of Chauntea has sent dreadful blight on the Earth Luna (location: Priapor Arntly), a minor creation of the Lords of Waterdeep..."

### 3. Encounters Section
Bulleted list of 3-5 key encounters:
- **Investigating [X]**: Investigation/exploration encounters with skill checks
- **Combat encounters**: Brief description with enemy type
- **Social encounters**: NPCs to interact with
- **Puzzle/trap encounters**: Mechanical challenges

Each bullet should be concise (1-2 sentences) with specific details:
- What the characters encounter
- Relevant skill checks or DCs
- Key information revealed or obstacles overcome

### 4. Location Details
**[Location Name]**: Brief description of the dungeon/location

#### Room-by-Room Breakdown
For each significant room:
- **Room Name**: One-sentence description
- **Encounters**: Monsters, traps, or challenges with full mechanics
- **Interactables**: What players can investigate or use
- **Connections**: How rooms link together

**Mechanical Details Format:**
- Monster types clearly stated (e.g., "A Psychic Gray Ooze")
- Traps: "DC [X] [Ability] saving throw, taking [XdX] [Type] damage on a failed save or half as much on success"
- Skill checks: "DC [X] [Skill] check"

### 5. Map Integration
- Adventures reference a battle map with labeled rooms
- Map scale: "1 Square = 5 Feet"
- Maps can be reused across different adventures with different encounters

## Writing Style Guidelines

### Tone
- **Concise**: Every word counts on one page
- **Active voice**: "A Psychic Gray Ooze lurks..." not "There is a Psychic Gray Ooze"
- **Evocative but efficient**: Create atmosphere in few words
- **Clear mechanics**: No ambiguity in rules, DCs, or effects

### Faerun Integration
- Reference specific deities (Chauntea, Tymora, Bane, etc.)
- Mention factions (Lords of Waterdeep, Harpers, Zhentarim, etc.)
- Use established locations (Waterdeep, Neverwinter, Baldur's Gate, etc.)
- Include cultural details that make it feel like Faerun

For detailed Faerun lore, see [faerun-lore.md](faerun-lore.md)

### Length Constraints
- **Total length**: Fits on one page when formatted
- **Hook**: 2-3 sentences max
- **Each encounter bullet**: 1-2 sentences
- **Room descriptions**: 1-3 sentences each
- **Mechanics**: Inline, not in separate stat blocks

## Mechanical Guidelines

### DCs by Level
- **Level 1-4**: Easy DC 10, Medium DC 13, Hard DC 15
- **Level 5-10**: Easy DC 12, Medium DC 15, Hard DC 18
- **Level 11-16**: Easy DC 14, Medium DC 17, Hard DC 20
- **Level 17-20**: Easy DC 16, Medium DC 19, Hard DC 22

### Damage Ranges
- **Level 1**: 1d6-1d8 for traps/hazards, 2d6 for deadly
- **Level 2-4**: 2d6-2d8, 4d6 for deadly
- **Level 5-10**: 4d6-4d10, 8d6 for deadly
- **Level 11+**: Scale appropriately

### Encounter Balance
- One main combat encounter appropriate for the party level
- 1-2 minor combat encounters or hazards
- Mix of combat, exploration, and problem-solving
- At least one skill challenge or investigation opportunity

## Instructions for Generation

When generating a one-page adventure:

1. **Start with the map**: Reference an available map and build encounters around its rooms
2. **Choose a level**: Select appropriate level and use corresponding DCs/damage
3. **Create the hook**: Tie it to specific Faerun lore (deity, faction, or location)
4. **Design encounters**:
   - 1 main combat encounter
   - 1-2 investigation/exploration moments
   - 1 trap or puzzle
   - 1 social or story element
5. **Write room descriptions**: Match room names to map labels
6. **Add mechanics inline**: DCs, damage, monster types
7. **Verify length**: Should fit on one page

## Instructions for Evaluation

When evaluating an adventure, assess:

1. **Story coherence**: Clear hook, logical progression, satisfying resolution
2. **Faerun accuracy**: Correct use of lore, appropriate setting details
3. **Mechanical soundness**: Balanced encounters, appropriate DCs, usable mechanics
4. **Format and usability**: Easy to run at the table, fits on one page
