# Example Adventures

## The Curse on Humble Hill

*Annotated example from Adventures in Faerun*

### Title Section
**Title**: The Curse on Humble Hill
**Tagline**: Explore an Adventure? (6)
**Level**: Level 1

**Analysis**: Title creates intrigue with "Curse" and uses a specific location. Tagline is brief and mysterious.

---

### Hook
*The Gaunt of Chauntea has sent dreadful blight on the Earth Luna (location: Priapor Arntly), a minor creation of the Lords of Waterdeep. He seeks aid, but the local folk lied as to the risk of it all.*

**Analysis**:
- Ties to **Chauntea** (deity of agriculture) - thematically appropriate for blight
- References **Lords of Waterdeep** (major Faerun faction)
- Creates tension: locals lied about the danger
- Establishes stakes: blight threatening the land

---

### Encounters

**Investigating Humble Hill**: The people of Humble Hill are wary of the party, interacting with locals when Characters investigate why their crops are dying. Use Investigation or Persuasion to learn "the Gaunt" summoned dark forces to save his failing farmland that eventually cursed his land.

**Analysis**: Investigation/social encounter with clear skill checks (Investigation/Persuasion)

**Finding Gaunt Brunt**: Before the party reaches the lab there is a haunting encounter with "the Gaunt" himself. Gaunt Brunt desperately and passionately pleads for them to turn back. A successful DC 13 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals he is a corpse animated by dark magic.

**Analysis**:
- Atmospheric encounter with twist
- Specific DC (13) and skill check (Intelligence Investigation)
- Appropriate DC for Level 1 (medium difficulty)

**Entering Gaunt's Lair**: The lair is built into the bottom of the hill. The party's journey through Gaunt's place starts on the roof and works downward. A trap door with a ladder leads into the bedroom and the rest of the underground place.

**Analysis**: Establishes location structure and entry point

**Exiting Gaunt's Lair**: Once the party locates the blight (which has been contaminated by fertilizer it use), they also must free Gaunt's prisoners from the prison cells. They have been endlessly cursed for similar piety to him as they rot away.

**Analysis**:
- Victory condition: locate the blight source
- Additional objective: rescue prisoners
- Moral dimension: prisoners cursed for similar reasons as Gaunt

### Random Encounter Table (Optional Element)

| d4 | Encounter |
|----|-----------|
| 1  | Finding small and stone effigies depicting dead wheat |
| 2  | A cursing haunt (dog, cow someone's pet, now cursed by Gaunt's Brunt) |

### Location: Gaunt's Lab

*Use the map and features below for Gaunt's lab*

#### Ooze Chamber
A **Psychic Gray Ooze** lurks in puddles of dirty water. When characters approach, it initiates combat.

**Analysis**:
- Clear monster type with descriptor (Psychic Gray Ooze)
- Trigger condition (when characters approach)
- Active voice ("lurks," "initiates")

#### Laboratory
Gaunt's lab notes and equipment can be used to create an antidote to the fertilizer.

**Analysis**: Solution to the adventure's main problem

#### Study
Gaunt studies his field notes here. If discovered one can escape through the trapped hallway and up the ladder in his bedroom, which leads back to the surface.

**Analysis**:
- Provides context (Gaunt's research)
- Escape route information
- Connects to other rooms (trapped hallway, bedroom)

#### Trap
Medium or larger creatures stepping on the pressure plate activate ceiling nozzles that spray acid. Creatures in the hall make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d6 Acid damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful save.

**Analysis**:
- Specific trigger: size restriction (Medium+) and pressure plate
- Exact mechanics: DC 13 Dexterity save
- Damage: 2d6 Acid (appropriate for Level 1)
- Half damage on success (standard 5e format)

### Map Integration

**Map**: Gaunt's Lab (map-01.001-gaunts-lab.jpg)
- Scale: 1 Square = 5 Feet
- Labeled rooms match location descriptions
- Professional battle map style
- Rooms: Ooze Chamber, Laboratory, Prison, Study, Supply Room, Trash Pit, Fertilizer Storage, Bedroom

**Analysis**: Map can be reused with different encounters/adventure hooks

## Key Patterns Observed

### Structure
1. Clear three-act structure: Hook → Investigation → Resolution
2. Multiple encounter types: Social, exploration, combat, trap
3. Environmental storytelling through location details

### Faerun Integration
- Deity connection (Chauntea)
- Faction reference (Lords of Waterdeep)
- Specific location (Humble Hill, implied to be near Waterdeep region)

### Mechanical Clarity
- All DCs specified (DC 13)
- Damage values exact (2d6 Acid)
- Monster types named (Psychic Gray Ooze)
- Saving throw types clear (Dexterity)

### Efficiency
- Entire adventure fits on 1-2 pages with map
- No stat blocks needed (references standard monsters)
- Inline mechanics don't break narrative flow

### Themes
- Consequences of desperate actions (Gaunt's curse from using dark magic)
- Environmental corruption (blight from fertilizer)
- Redemption opportunity (freeing prisoners, creating antidote)
